# PESTO - Parameter EStimation TOolbox

PESTO is a widely applicable and highly customizable toolbox for parameter estimation in MathWorks MATLAB. It offers state-of-the art algorithms for optimization and uncertainty analysis, which work in a very generic manner, treating the objective function as a black box. Hence, PESTO can be used for any parameter estimation problem, which provides an objective function in MATLAB.


PESTO features include:
* Multistart optimization
* Sampling routines
* Profile-likelihood analysis
* Visualization routines
* and more

These function are demonstrated in several systems biology examples included in the `examples/` directory.
